We are three brothers, Keno, Korbin, and Kasden, who share a deep passion for technology, innovation, finance, and venture capital. All three of us have had the honor of attending the United States Military Academy, which has shaped our discipline, leadership, and drive for excellence. Our mission is to leverage our skills and experiences to innovate and invest in the tech industry.

    - This logo is for the "nobinden Foundation". We primarily do investing in tech startups. However, would like to broaden out more to media, finance,  leadership. The founders are 3 brothers.
    - The name "nobinden" is derived from the last few letters of each of our names: Ke**NO**, Kor**BIN**, and Kas**DEN**. It also carries the hidden meaning of "no bending," symbolizing the unbreakable bond we share as brothers.

    - We would like the logo to be modern, futuristic and simple. 
    - We would also like to play around with the idea of stacking no, bin, den in a square. 
    - Perferably we would like to use cooler pastel tones, like blue and grey.
    - Some examples of what we would like to emulate: Y-Combinator, Sequoia Capital, Andreesen Horowitz
