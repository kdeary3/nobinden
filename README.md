We are three brothers, Keno, Korbin, and Kasden, who share a deep passion for technology, innovation, finance, and venture capital. All three of us have had the honor of attending the United States Military Academy, which has shaped our discipline, leadership, and drive for excellence. Our mission is to leverage our skills and experiences to innovate and invest in the tech industry.
